# derbyNew

This is the raw project that's created by
      derby new derbyNew

command, and you can use this as a template to learn the 
structure of derby projects. 

Comparing this with my code would also be helpful.

# Reason of Existence
Derby's create new projecct command on MacOSX is current not working, 
I suspect this has something to do with the make project during 
      npm install.
So I setup this raw/clean project for people's convenience.
